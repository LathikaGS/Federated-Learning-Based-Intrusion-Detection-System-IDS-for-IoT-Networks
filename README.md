# üõ°Ô∏è Federated Learning-Based IDS for IoT using NS-3 and LSTM

This project simulates a **Federated Learning (FL)**-based **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** for IoT networks using **NS-3** and **NetAnim**. It detects **DDoS attacks** in real-time using a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** based model, trained in a decentralized manner using the **Federated Averaging (FedAvg)** algorithm.

## ‚ú® Features
- **DDoS Attack Simulation in NS-3**: Emulates IoT communication and malicious traffic.
- **Network Visualization with NetAnim**: Animates how the attack spreads and how packets flow.
- **Federated Learning Framework**: Distributed training on simulated IoT nodes.
- **LSTM-based Model**: Learns to detect attacks based on network traffic patterns.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üß∞ Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch (for LSTM and FL model)
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- NS-3 (tested with v3.36+)
- NetAnim (bundled with NS-3)

---

### üîß Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fl-ids-ns3
   cd fl-ids-ns3
   
2. **Install Python Dependencies**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## How It Works

### 1. DDoS Traffic Simulation (NS-3)
- Simulates an IoT network with devices, a server, and malicious nodes.
- Attackers launch DDoS via UDP floods and TCP SYN floods, overwhelming the server.
- Legitimate traffic gets delayed or dropped.

### 2. Packet Capture & Feature Extraction
- NS-3 captures network traffic using built-in tools.
- Extracts features like packet counts, IP frequency, protocols, and timings.
- Prepares structured datasets for model training.

### 3. Federated Learning with LSTM
- Each IoT node trains a local LSTM model on its own data (time-series traffic patterns).
- Nodes share only model parameters, preserving data privacy.
- FedAvg algorithm averages weights to create a global model shared across nodes.

### 4. Real-Time Intrusion Detection
- The global LSTM model analyzes incoming traffic sequences.
- Detects abnormal patterns indicating DDoS attacks.
- Flags attacks for mitigation.

### Why This Approach?
| Traditional IDS       | Federated Learning IDS      |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| Centralized data      | Data stays local (privacy)   |
| Limited scalability   | Scalable across devices      |
| Static retraining     | Adaptive, real-time learning |
| High resource usage   | Lightweight for IoT devices  |
